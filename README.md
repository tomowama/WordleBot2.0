This bot allows you to beat wordle in an average of 3.6 guesses, which is better than human play. 

This bot is also a great starting point to adding more sophsiticated guessing algorithms for the bot to play. This can be done by editing the optimalGuess
function. Furthermore, the runner() function will allow one to test the average rounds needed per word needed to get the correct word.

You can play on the main wordle site with this bot, or enter your own word to the bot and have it complete the wordle you set.
